# Howdy!
I'm Dan. 馃帀 I'm a developer, designer, and writer. I study information design and data visualization
as a graduate student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) in Boston, MA.
## What I Like Doing
I enjoy making graphics and interactive toys to explain concepts and data. I especially like 
undertaking projects that involve journalism, narrative, and presenting a big idea. Most of my work
utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like [D3](https://d3js.org). 

I'm a firm believer in the power of words. Writing is my therapy.

I also love teaching!

## What I'm Doing Now (Updated 8-19-18)
* About to start my final year of classes. I have to make a thesis. It's probably going to involve baseball.
* Learning React from a great [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
* Teaching myself piano.
* Starting a blog, because the writing folder on my desktop is getting a bit stale.
* Reading [The Book of Jonas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12528627-the-book-of-jonas) by Stephen Dau.
